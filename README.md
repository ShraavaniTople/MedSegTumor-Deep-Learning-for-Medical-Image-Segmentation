# MedSegTumor-Deep-Learning-for-Medical-Image-Segmentation

# Overview of the Project:
This project aims to develop a deep-learning model for medical image segmentation, specifically targeting the detection of tumors in MRI scans. The model will utilize a U-Net architecture implemented in TensorFlow and Keras.

# Problem Statement and Objectives:
The problem statement involves automating the process of tumor detection in medical images to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosis and treatment planning. The objectives are to:

1)Develop an accurate segmentation model.

2)Evaluate the model's performance using relevant metrics.

3)Provide a user-friendly interface for running the model on new medical images
